# AGI: Applied General Intelligence

## Discussion group
Mathematical tools work well on mathematical objects (such as sets and rings of numbers), and the equation model F(X)=Y, which describes a triplet (F,X,Y), is sufficiently abstractly for defining, and expressing the pursuit of any **goals** (Y), with respect to any **world** (F), by any **process** that varies (X). In a sense, the artificial intelligence has been created thousands of years ago, when the first automatic/mechanistic way (a set of rules as a process) to solve equation was invented.

Today, there exists systems, that can meaningfully ingest or bind to identities of any data objects, and apply arbitrary programs to them, creating a framework for partly-artificial, partly human **a**pplied **g**eneral **i**ntelligence.

These systems turn out to be very useful at all levels of organization.


The topic of our discussions on this list are:

(1) What frameworks of general intelligence exist.

(2) Finding out what general intelligence (or close to general) systems already exist, and how to tap into them.

(3) What protocols are or can be used to connect different systems of general intelligence.

## Known General Intelligence Systems

### Pure
- Lisp

### Combined
- Emacs
- WolframAlpha
- Singularity.NET
- Infinity.Family

## Known General Intelligence Frameworks

### (F) Representing world
- Infinity data (system of types, schemas, instances) to collect and understand ("import") arbitrary data with arbitrary ontologies.

### (Y) Representing goals
- Lisp, as programmable programming language to abstract out/import all other programming languages. 

### (X) Representing processes
- Runner/Clock/Scheduler. (Any universal ones in existence?)
